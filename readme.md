## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there was a much big spike in different amounts in Loan Original amount like 4k, 5K,10k, and 15k, almost few ask for fractions and a lot ask for multiples of five. when plotting the term data I found that a high percentage of borrowers make a loan for 3 term years and when plotting the term with Loan original amount I found that if the borrowers need a high amount it is a high probability that he makes a loan in 5 years term.
borrowers that have a low range in monthly income high probability that he passed his repayment date lower-income higher delay for payment. loan with the 1-year term has a higher Monthly loan payment and that is because it has a high loan original amount
